Machine learning desktop app, convolutional neural network implementation, supports network creation/configuraton/training, trained image network can use inference to resample/blend/morph images. Network configuration and training progress can be saved/loaded. Written using MFC/C++/intel tbb/jpeglib, more details can be found here:

Supplied 7 pre-trained '*.ml' files in the "./training dir", "*_id_xy.ml" files have been trained on 2 images and can morph images, "*_id.ml" files have been trained on 2 images andcan blend.

Trained networks:
  spiderman mask <-> spiderman symbol
  david banner <-> hulk
  lion <-> tiger
  ghostbusters
